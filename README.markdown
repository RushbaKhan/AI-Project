# AI-Project 🤖 - PDF Chatbot & AI-Powered Scrabble Game

Welcome to **AI-Project**, an innovative integration of **ByteBot**, a PDF chatbot, and an **AI-Powered Scrabble Game**. ByteBot lets you chat with PDF documents using NLP, while the Scrabble game features an AI opponent that learns new words from ByteBot's responses. This project, built with **Streamlit**, **LangChain**, and **Tkinter**, combines education and entertainment seamlessly.

## 📖 Usage (via GitHub Website)

### 1. Access the Repository
- Navigate to `https://github.com/Rushbakhan/AI-Project` in your browser.

### 2. Install Dependencies
- To run the project, you’ll need to set up a local environment with Python and install dependencies. Download the `requirements.txt` file:
  - Click on `requirements.txt`, then click "Raw."
  - Right-click and select "Save as" to download it.
  - You’ll need to install these dependencies locally to run the project (see [Dependencies](#-dependencies) below).

### 3. Run ByteBot Locally
- Download `app.py` and related files:
  - Click on `app.py`, then click "Raw" and download the file.
  - Repeat for `pdf_chatbot_setup.py` and other necessary files (e.g., `valid_words.txt`).
  - On your computer, ensure Python and dependencies are installed, then run:
    ```
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
  - Upload a PDF and start chatting. Words from ByteBot's responses will be saved to `valid_words.txt`.

### 4. Run Scrabble Game Locally
- Download `scrabble.py` and related files:
  - Click on `scrabble.py`, click "Raw," and download.
  - Download `valid_words.txt` and `nlp_words.txt` as well.
  - On your computer, run:
    ```
    python scrabble.py
    ```
  - Play against the AI, which uses words from `valid_words.txt`.

### 5. Experience Integration
- As you chat with ByteBot, the Scrabble AI dynamically updates its vocabulary, enhancing gameplay. You can upload the updated `valid_words.txt` back to the repository via the GitHub website if needed.
