# ByteBot 🤖 - Chat with Your PDFs  

ByteBot is an AI-powered chatbot built with **Streamlit** and **LangChain**, enabling users to chat with their PDF documents. The chatbot utilizes **FAISS** for vector storage and **LLaMA 2** (via CTransformers) as the language model to process and answer document-based queries efficiently.  

## Features 🚀  

- 📂 **Upload PDFs** and interact with them in real time.  
- 🔎 **Conversational Retrieval** to fetch relevant information from the document.  
- 🧠 **Memory Integration** for maintaining chat history across interactions.  
- ⚡ **Efficient Vector Search** using **FAISS** for quick retrieval.  
- 🤗 **Hugging Face Embeddings** for accurate text representation.  
- 🎨 **Streamlit UI** for a user-friendly chat experience.  

## Tech Stack 🛠️  

- **Streamlit** for frontend and UI components.  
- **LangChain** for document processing and conversational AI.  
- **FAISS** for efficient vector storage.  
- **Hugging Face Transformers** for text embeddings.  
- **CTransformers** for running LLaMA 2 models locally.  
- **PyPDFLoader** for extracting text from PDFs.  

## Usage 📖
